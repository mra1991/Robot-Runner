# Robot Runner
This project is an infinite runner style game developed using older versions of OpenGL in the C programming language. 
The game was created entirely from scratch without the use of any game engines or external tools. 
The project showcases my ability to program complex graphics and physics in OpenGL and implement a fully functional game without relying on pre-built solutions. Additionally, the project includes custom tools developed specifically for the game, which can be found in the mains folder along with the game itself.
